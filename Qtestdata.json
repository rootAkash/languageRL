        "n_action": " assistant:One common two-factor authentication method is SMS verification, which involves sending an SMS (text) message to a mobile phone number linked to the user being verified. This method has the benefit of being familiar to many users, and only requires that they have access to a mobile phone. However, it could exclude users who are not able to use a mobile phone. It is also vulnerable to attacks such as SIM-jacking. SIM-jacking is a social engineering attack where cyber-criminals use social engineering against a phone company to take over a person's mobile phone number, and then use that access to bypass two-factor authentication. SMS verification may also be costly for organisations supporting large applications on a small budget, as SMS gateways charge money to send messages.\n\nAnother method is to require an authenticator app for two-factor authentication. Authenticator apps store a secret key shared with the website the user is authenticating to (often transferred into the app as a QR code via the phone's camera), and generate codes that change over time (time-based one-time pads, or TOTP) for entry into the application. Authenticator apps provide greater security than SMS verification, as long as the device the app is on is not compromised. They also avoid any significant additional operational cost for either the user or the application provider, because users can use Free / Open Source authenticator apps, and the approach does not require any kind of gateway service to implement on the server side. On the flip side, less technically savvy users might not be willing or able to install an authenticator app. Also, if users wipe or replace their phone without taking care to first set up an authenticator app on their new device, they might lose access to their account, or require an alternative process to reset it. It does carry the risk that users could be socially engineered into providing their code to phishing site. Since it relies on a shared secret, if a criminal gains even temporary read-only access to a copy of the secrets stored on the server, they can use those secrets to bypass two-factor authentication until the user's second-factor secret is reset.\n\nA third option is to require a U2F compatible security key. These are physical devices that connect to a computer (over USB or wirelessly over NFC) and use public-key cryptography to prove that the user has access to the private key corresponding to the public key on the server. This is the most secure option. Security keys are typically hardened to prevent cloning, so users can have high confidence that if they are currently in possession of the key, no one else can impersonate that key. The protocols have measures to prevent phishing on a different fake site to log in to the real site, something the other methods are vulnerable to. Some keys include mechanisms such as biometric checks to prevent misuse of physical keys. However, most U2F security keys are vulnerable to some extent to misuse following the physical theft of the keys. This approach has the downside that users would need to obtain a U2F key from somewhere if they don't already have one, which introduces friction and carries cost implications.
